Simple Selenium
===============

A simple [selenium webdriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) project to get started writing tests fast. 
It uses Webdriver to run a java test that goes to a specific web site and assert the URL of the site. 

The tests are written with [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) and assertions are written with [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/).

This repository could be used to get started with Selenium.
